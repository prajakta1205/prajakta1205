### 👩‍💻 About Me

I’m a **Senior Software Engineer with 8+ years of experience** building **scalable backend systems**, **cloud-native APIs**, and **Microservices architectures** using **.NET and Microsoft Azure**.

I specialize in designing **high-performance REST APIs**, microservices, and clean architectures that scale reliably in production. I enjoy working close to both **system design and implementation**, and I’ve contributed as an individual contributor across multiple domains.

On the frontend, I work with **JavaScript, TypeScript, and React**, including **micro-frontend architectures**, to build maintainable and performant user experiences.
